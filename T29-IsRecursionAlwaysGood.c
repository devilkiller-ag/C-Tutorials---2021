Notes / Theory: 
Why is Recursion not always good ?
 Iterative approach takes less time as in case of Fibonacci Series it doesnâ€™t call same no. again and again but in Recursive approach it calls same no. again and again i.e. many times.

    1 - Recursion is a good approach when it comes to problem solving.
    2 - However, programmer needs to evaluate the need and impact of using recursive/iterative approach while solving a particular problem.
    3 - In case of Factorial calculation, recursion saved a lot of lines of code.
    4 - However in case of Fibonacci Series recursive approach called many functions again and again causing time waste.

So, programmer must have to evaluate which approach he/she should use to solve any particular problem.
